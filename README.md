# Contact Management System

The contact management system is a simple program that allows you to manage your contacts easily. You can add new contacts, display all contacts, update existing contacts, delete contacts, save contacts to a file, and load contacts from a file.

## Getting Started

To use the contact management system, you need to have a C compiler installed on your computer. You can download and install a C compiler such as [GCC](https://gcc.gnu.org/) or [Clang](https://clang.llvm.org/) on your computer.

Once you have a C compiler installed, you can download the source code for the contact management system from this GitHub repository. You can compile the source code using the following command:
```bash
gcc -o contact.exe contact.c
```

This will create an executable file named `contact.exe` that you can run on your computer.

## Usage

To use the contact management system, you can run the `contact.exe` executable file from the command line. The program will display a menu with the following options:

- Add new contact
- Display all contacts
- Update existing contact
- Delete contact
- Save contacts to file
- Load contacts from file
- Exit

You can select an option by entering the corresponding number and pressing Enter. The program will guide you through the process of adding, displaying, updating, or deleting contacts.
